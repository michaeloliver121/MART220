I had ChatGPT create something similar to my own code and I think that (like last time) it makes my code look a little archaic by me just not knowing enough about it to get things to work how I envision them. I think stylistically, the AI is trying to recreate a stereotypical RPG map, but I think it falls short this week too. There isn't any rhyme or reason as to what it is trying to create in regards to locations and placement. The map it created was of a coastal region, which it did correctly, but it put multiple landmarks in locations where they shouldn't be. There is a port in the middle of the landmass, there is a mountain in the middle of the water, etc. While it's fantasy, and there is some merit to being creative and having creative liberty when it comes to geography and what not, the AI doesn't necessarily think creatively like that, and more places things in ways that it thinks it should be placed, rather than a creative design choice with imagination behind it. The player icon is much better than mine though, and I like how it follows your mouse location and I like the lineword on the coastline. The major issue I have with this is the clouds or whatever it is attempting to do with the circles and ovals? Looks way too chaotic and doesn't add much other than making it not fun to look at. Anyways, I think at the very least, my map is alright for what I know, and I'm sure I can get much better at some point!
