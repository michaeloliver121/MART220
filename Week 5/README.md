This week was rough. Honestly I struggle to understand a lot when it comes to coding, and for whatever reason it just does not click with me. I feel like I understand it a bit more when I write down a million comments explaining what it does, but honestly I am just pretty bad at it unless I spend a ton of time looking online for help. Unsure if there is a way for me to retain this information a bit better, but I don't think I learned much from Creative Coding I at all (with Cory). I struggle with his teaching methods so I feel a bit lacking when it comes to feeling prepared for this class. Anyways, hoping by next week I will be able to figure out how to rotate the boat now since the wake and what not makes absolutely zero sense when it moves any other way than right (none of this makes sense though, there is literally a tiny boat in a bowl of fruit loops). Hoping it comes together a bit more though, and hoping that I can get past this mental block!
